This Repository will Serve as a Hand-Book for <b>Competitive-Coding</b> in and beyond Engima.
It houses the Description, Implementation, and Analysis of mostly used Data-Structures and Algorithms in any of your favorite language.
Hope this Repository serves it's purpose well.

Kindly Follow the Contributing Guide.

Happy Learning :)

## Contribution Guide
---
1. Fork this Repository and make a Pull Request.
2. Every Data Structure and Algorithm can be implemented in any language of your choice. Just make sure you follow the rest of the contributing rules
3. Data Structures are to be put into ddifferent folders. Each folder can have only one implememtation of the said Data-Structure in each language.
4. Every Paradigm of Algorithms can have many algorithms belonging to them. Make sure you make a folder for each of these algorithms inside the correct paradigm. Each Algorithm may have several sub-folders according to the language of implementation of the Algorithm. Each of these Language Sub-Folders may have different implementation of the same algorithm.
5. Each commit must properly be named and the PR must not have merge conflicts.
6. Include proper documentation for the data structures and Algorithms you are implementing. So that it'll be easier for others to understand your approach and implementation.
